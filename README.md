### MySQL Project: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this project, I worked with raw, unstructured data and transformed it into a clean, reliable dataset ready for analysis. Using MySQL, I performed comprehensive data cleaning operations including:

Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records

Standardizing data types and formats for consistency

Creating optimized SQL queries to improve data integrity

After cleaning, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and trends. Key steps included:

Writing aggregate queries (GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINs) to analyze relationships across tables

Using window functions for ranking, running totals, and advanced insights

Identifying outliers, distributions, and correlations within the dataset

### Outcome: The project demonstrates my ability to transform messy datasets into meaningful insights, laying the foundation for advanced analytics and visualization in tools like Power BI and Python.
